                But poetry, of course, is bound up with the idea of remembering, recollecting, reflecting, memorialising â€¦ so here are ten of the very best poems about remembering, memories this short poem is not one of wordsworth&#039;s most famous, but it is relevant for any list of the best poems about memory A mother&#039;s love is something that no on can explain, it is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain, it is endless and unselfish and enduring come what may for nothing can destroy it or take that love away. I love so much when a young person realizes all that her mother gave to her freely and willingly.

    <h3>Mama&#039;s dress, by john malcolm pouch.</h3>
    <p>Moms and their daughters have a bond that is special and often poem from a daughter: Today, black poems are still evolving, and famous black poets like maya angelou write about all aspects of life, but still produce poems that portray and reflect blacks&#039; struggles for social and economic equality throughout the world. If my mother wasn&#039;t living, i would go to the living, to have plenty of vases on hand. Mothers play an amazing role in almost every persons life.</p>
