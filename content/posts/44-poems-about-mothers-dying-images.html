                Our collection of poems from a daughter captures. A mother&#039;s love is something that no on can explain, it is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain, it is endless and unselfish and enduring come what may for nothing can destroy it or take that love away. Every year, many of us struggle to find the perfect way to express how much we love our moms.
    </p>

    <h3>It is heartbreaking to see a once active relative lying in a hospital bed hooked up to watching beloved mother dying.</h3>
    <p>Love everlasting my mother is charming, her food is enchanting, but her love is everlasting. A mother is a person who loves and cares for you. Love everlasting my mother is charming, her food is enchanting, but her love is everlasting. And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly.</p>
