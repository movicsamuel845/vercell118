                Poems about old age and life, poems about aging and dealing with getting old. Mom, from the time i was really young, i realized i had someone.you, who always cared, who always protected me, who was. As judith says, i once had these conversations with my mother.
    </p>

    <h3>A mother&#039;s love is something that no on can explain, it is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain, it is endless and unselfish and enduring come what may for nothing can destroy it or take that love away.</h3>
    <p>Poems about aging, a collection of poetry about the aging process and watching our family and loved ones get older. I was very young once, and i can&#039;t seem to remember growing old. While on this beautiful journey, may be you can try writing some poems about pregnancy, and share them with your bundle of joy someday. Without you i shall not breathe, without you i shall die.</p>
