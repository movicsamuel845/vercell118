    <h3>Finally something uplifting for sons and mothers of sons.</h3>
    <p>A mother knows her son better than anyone ever could because i gave you life and help you shine your light. It&#039;s had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up what advice does the mother give to her son? I&#039;m going to put this in the book i&#039;m going to start for him and give him when he graduates high school. These mother and son quotes are perfect for sons to share with their moms on mother&#039;s day.</p>
